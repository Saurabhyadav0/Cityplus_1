# Streetlight Outage Reporter 🚦📱

A mobile app that empowers citizens to report malfunctioning streetlights by clicking photos, automatically tagging the location via GPS, and categorizing issues based on priority. The app ensures faster resolution by helping authorities track, sort, and respond to outages efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Photo Capture** – Take pictures of malfunctioning streetlights directly from the app.  
- 📍 **GPS Tagging** – Automatically attaches location (latitude & longitude) with every report.  
- ⚡ **Priority-Based Sorting** – Issues are ranked based on severity and location context (e.g., highways, residential areas, school zones).  
- 📊 **Dashboard for Authorities** – View all reports, sort/filter by priority, and track resolution status.  
- 🔔 **Notifications** – Users receive updates when their reported issue is acknowledged or fixed.  
- 🌐 **Offline Mode** – Save reports offline and sync when internet is available.
